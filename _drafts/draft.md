A Newspaper you Read 

I read Newspaper almost everyday. Prothom alo is the most favorite daily newspaper to me. 
Prothom alo is the largest circulated newspaper in Bangladesh.

Prothom alo cover almost all type of news 
like domestice, international, sports, technology, study, job, Business, Education, Entertainment. 

In my case, I generally love technology and Entertainment related news. 

Prothom alo also having some complementary tabloid
like nakhsha and roshalo. Naksha cover recipe, decoration, trendy stuff, modeling, fashion
Roshalo kind of satirical tabloid. Its cover funny news, cartoon.
Earlier Prothom alo offered Alpin instead of Rosh alo.
As some of people strike against some contradictory cartoon they discontinue their Alpin and introduce Rosh alo

Though I used to read physical newspaper a lot, but now a days I read news mostly at online. Due to conveniences.

I think reading newspaper is a good habit. Its help me up and running with latest news around the world.
I think reading newspaper enrich your vocabulary.
I can easily updated my self with latest news, facts, discoveries, research, technology.
