I can strengthen my willpower just as I can strengthen my body 


Unwavering focus -> by hindu monk 

Willpower can be defined as control exerted to do something or restrain impulses



#### 1. Always finish what you start
* I finish sleeping -> make the bed 
* I am done eating -> cleaning dishwasher 
* Set small goals for yourself and finish them no matter what 
like I'm committed to finishing the chapter I started 
* I am re-programming my SUBCONSCIOUS mind!. You can grab one of my personal sets of affirmations 

#### 2. Do a little bit more than you think you can 
If our willpower is not trained enough, it will fail us     
* going little bit more 
* You can do a little bit more by tidying your room ( as little bit more than organizing bed)
* I will sometimes take the garbage out (as little bit more than washing dish)

#### 3. Do something a little bit better than you think you can 

* We can always make our bed a little bit better.     
* We can always wash our dishes a little bit better. 

Let's invest a little bit more effort 

This method increase your
willpower by indirectly 
forcing you to take control  
of your actions so yo can  
do things in a better way .


1. finishing things 
2. doing a little bit more 
3. doing things a little bit better

the most critical           
words you say,           
are the ones you           
say to yourself

can help you achieve your              
dreams and vanish your fears

the words you say to yourself everyday 


Empower yourself with believe and statements 

The first step to use              
affirmations for Success is to               
actually define what                
Success looks like to you               


Tailored to your particular goals 

I can accomplish           
my goals as long           
as I work           
and Learn            


I wasted 2 years of my
life between jobs  I didn't  
care about and  
self employment that was  
not leading me anywhere    


Where you wan to be in a couple of years? 

What do you want to your life to be like?    


#### Affirmations can be divided under 2 categories 
1. Goal Affirmations
  - Are concerned with the           
    results you want in your life 
  - I have the body of my          
  dreams now that I weight        
  75kg with 10% body fat
2. Action Affirmations
  - They empower you to do the     
  things needed to achieve your goals      
  - You must eat healthy,   
  exercise, sleep better    
  and reduce your stress      
  - today I will eat only the most nourishing      
  and healthy foods in order to give       
  my body the best care that I can       

Action => Results        

#### How to write affirmations 

1. Start with "I" any of the         
following verbs can/will/do        
2. Next, you have to write a       
particular goal or action 
3. Make sure to include very      
emotional words that excite       
your imagination         

example:        
I am willing to exercise     
5 times per week to get     
that fantastic body     
that I deserve      

Start with 10 affirmations      
and commit them      
to memory       

Put affirmations into action       

I've found that recorded      
affirmations have a better effect on my memory      

Mastering your affirmations is like mastering a new habit     

Repeat your affirmations as often as possible        
like while bathing, at bathroom, while in working table, while in study table     


they work faster if you repeat them frequently         

##### Combine affirmations with coherent action        

If you want better     
results, you must      
take better actions        


the repetition of the words       
makes the actions 99%      
easier to do than before        


- Take care of your diet       
- Exercise 
- Go early to bed
